# Resumes Folder

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I store various versions of my resumes. Each resume is crafted using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Feel free to explore and download the latest version.

## How I Use VSCode for Resumes

I utilize Visual Studio Code for creating and editing my resumes, incorporating JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for a dynamic and visually appealing presentation. Each resume is maintained in a clean and readable format, making it easy to update and customize for different opportunities.

## Usage

Feel free to download and use any of the resumes for reference or as a starting point for creating your own. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Contact
